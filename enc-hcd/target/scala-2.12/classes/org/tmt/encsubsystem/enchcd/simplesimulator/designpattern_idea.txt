Known responsibilities which needs to be taken care somewhere in design pattern are
    * Handling socket connection
    * managing sync between command socket and command response socket
    * Mapping error code to csw command responses
    * Mapping subsystem response to csw command response parameter
    * Conversion of csw command parameter to protocol specific format for ex. binary.
    * manage chunks/parts of binary stream if required.
